# TortoiseBot

This repository contains a simple Gazebo robot with differential drive pluginand a hector_gazebo gps plugin which has a Ouster OS1-64 LiDAR mounted on it. Forked from stevenlee090's repo for use with the Vehicle State Estimation Subsystem and `https://github.com/mfkeane/avse.git`

## Dependencies & Setup

This was tested in Ubuntu 18.04, ROS Melodic, Gazebo 9.0.0, and assumes that you have catkin tools installed.

* `hector_gazebo` (for simulating Ouster IMU)
* `ouster_example` (forked by Wil Selby)
* `teleop_twist_keyboard`

Inside your `catkin_ws/src`, run the following to setup the required packages.

```
git clone https://github.com/mfkeane/tortoisebot
git clone https://github.com/stevenlee090/ouster_example
git clone https://github.com/tu-darmstadt-ros-pkg/hector_gazebo
```

Then install the `teleop_twist_keyboard` for controlling the robot movement.
```
sudo apt-get install ros-melodic-teleop-twist-keyboard
```

Build the packages at your `catkin_ws`.
```
catkin build
source devel/setup.bash
```

## Running the simulation

Launch the robot simulation, opening Gazebo simulator and RViz for point cloud visualisation.

```
roslaunch tortoisebot tortoisebot.launch

# run in another terminal
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```

You should also be greeted with something like the simulation shown below.
